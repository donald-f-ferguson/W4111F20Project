# Game of Thrones Data

- The datasets come from the GitHub project [Game of Thrones Datasets and Visualizations](https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones).


- The [README](https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones/blob/master/README.md) for the project explains the
datasets, visualizations, etc.


- The project's datasets are in JSON format. I wrote some simple Python programs that read the JSON files
and produce CSV files that you can load into MySQL.
